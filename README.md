- What I used to build this site are:
    - react
    - react router
    - react bootstrap
    - react authentications and so on...
    - Firbase
    - Used VS code to write codes.
    - This an website which is athenticated by E-mail and Google login. 
    - MongoDB has been used to keep data. 
    - Heroku has been used for server deployment 
    - The client side is on the Firebase, meaning we deployed the client side to the firbase. 
    
That's all in short. In futuer we will develope the side with more usefule and attractive features In-Sha-Allah.
